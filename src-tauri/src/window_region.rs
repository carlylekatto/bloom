//! Clips a Bloom window to the parts of the screen its UI actually draws on.
//!
//! Bloom's windows are large transparent rectangles (the notch window spans
//! the whole top band of the screen). Wherever such a window catches input,
//! it swallows clicks meant for the apps underneath, even where it draws
//! nothing. A window region (`SetWindowRgn`) limits both drawing and hit
//! testing to the given rectangles, so outside them the window doesn't exist
//! for input at all. Each webview reports the rectangles it needs, in its own
//! CSS pixels, whenever they change.
